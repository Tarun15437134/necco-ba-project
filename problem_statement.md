# Problem Statement

## Business Context

Necco is a multi-state child welfare social enterprise operating programs across Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia. Case managers are responsible for conducting timely home visits, maintaining compliance with state-mandated timelines, and documenting case progress accurately.

Leadership currently lacks centralized, real-time visibility into program performance. Compliance issues are identified reactively — after audits, state reviews, or escalated incidents — rather than through proactive monitoring.

## The Problem

Case managers across multiple states are missing compliance deadlines at varying rates, but there is no unified reporting system to:

- Surface which states or programs are underperforming
- Identify whether caseload size or worker experience drives non-compliance
- Track incident trends and near-miss patterns before they escalate
- Provide leadership with actionable, data-driven recommendations

## Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Role | Information Need |
|---|---|---|
| VP of Programs | Executive sponsor | High-level KPIs, risk flags |
| State Program Directors | Operational leads | State-level compliance trends |
| Compliance Team | Policy enforcement | Non-compliant case details |
| IT / Data Team | Systems support | Data integrity and reporting infrastructure |
| Case Managers | Front-line staff | Their own performance vs. team average |

## Project Goal

Design and deliver a business intelligence solution that:

1. Tracks visit compliance rate by state, program, and worker
2. Identifies root causes driving non-compliance in underperforming regions
3. Monitors incident and near-miss trends over time
4. Delivers actionable recommendations to leadership through an executive dashboard and memo

## Scope

- **States:** Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia
- **Programs:** Foster Care, Family Preservation, Residential, Therapeutic Foster Care
- **Time Period:** January – December 2023 (12-month analysis)
- **Data Sources:** Case management records, worker roster, incident log

## Success Metrics

- Compliance rate improves by 10+ percentage points in lowest-performing state within 2 quarters post-intervention
- Leadership has access to a self-serve dashboard updated monthly
- SOP adopted across all three states for consistent data entry
