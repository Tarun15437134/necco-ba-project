# Executive Recommendation Memo

---

**TO:** VP of Programs & Regional Directors
**FROM:** [Your Name], Business Analyst — Integrated Services
**DATE:** February 2024
**RE:** 2023 Program Performance Analysis — Compliance & Incident Findings

---

## Summary

A comprehensive analysis of 500 cases, 50 workers, and 150 incidents across Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia reveals that the organization's overall compliance rate is **51%** — significantly below the industry benchmark of 80%+. West Virginia is the lowest-performing state at **40%**, driven by caseload overload, a newer workforce, and slow incident resolution. Immediate, targeted intervention in West Virginia — combined with a company-wide Family Preservation staffing adjustment — is expected to lift overall compliance by 15+ percentage points within two quarters.

---

## Key Findings

- **West Virginia is in crisis:** All four program types in WV fall below 42% compliance. The root cause is structural — caseloads averaging 18–28 (vs. 10–16 in Ohio) combined with a predominantly junior workforce hired in 2021–2023.

- **Family Preservation is the organization's highest-risk program:** With a visit requirement every 7–14 days and the same caseload limits as lower-frequency programs, Family Preservation workers are structurally set up to miss deadlines. Missed visits account for 30% of all incidents filed.

- **Incident resolution is dangerously slow in WV:** Critical incidents in West Virginia average 22+ days to resolve — more than three times the Ohio average of 7 days. This creates legal, safety, and compliance exposure.

## Recommendations

1. **Immediately cap WV caseloads at 15 per worker and initiate hiring for 3–4 additional case managers.** Pair all WV workers with under 1 year of experience with a senior mentor. Expected impact: 12–18 point compliance improvement in WV within 6 months.

2. **Reform the Family Preservation caseload formula across all states.** Weight each Family Preservation case as 1.5x a standard case when calculating worker capacity. Partner with IT to implement automated visit-due alerts. Expected impact: 8–10 point improvement in Family Preservation compliance rate.

3. **Implement an incident response SOP with mandatory timelines.** Critical = 48-hour response, High = 5 days, Medium = 10 days. Assign a dedicated compliance liaison to the WV region. Expected impact: Reduce average WV resolution time from 22 days to under 7 days within one quarter.
